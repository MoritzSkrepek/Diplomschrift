This diploma thesis focuses on the development of an educational application for HTL Wiener Neustadt using the Unity
platform. The implementation took the form of an augmented reality (AR) application specifically designed for the
Microsoft HoloLens 2.

The application comprises three distinct levels, namely the main menu, the Ping Level, and the Knapsack-Problem
Level, all implemented using Unity.

During the open house event, the application enables students to explore two fundamental principles of computer
science in a playful and engaging manner through augmented reality. This provides students with the opportunity
to discover whether they have an interest in such topics. The utilization of Unity as the development platform
facilitated a comprehensive and scientifically grounded realization of this project.
