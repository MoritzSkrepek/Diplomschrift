This diploma thesis focuses on developing a learning application for the HTBLuVA Wiener Neustadt using the Unity platform.
The implementation took the form of an Augmented Reality (AR) application, specifically designed for the Microsoft HoloLens 2.

The application consists of three different scenarios, including the main menu, the message exchange, and the
Knapsack-Problem application scenario.

The application allows students to explore two fundamental principles of computer science playfully and engagingly
using augmented reality during the open house. This provides students with the opportunity to discover if they have
an interest in such topics. Additionally, the aim is to use this application in regular classes, allowing students
to apply and experiment with these principles/processes themselves.
