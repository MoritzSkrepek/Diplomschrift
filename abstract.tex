This thesis focuses on developing a learning application for HTL Wiener Neustadt using the Unity platform. The application
is an Augmented Reality (AR) application designed for the Microsoft HoloLens 2.

The application comprises three distinct scenarios, namely the main menu, the message exchange and knapsack-problem scenario.

The application enables students to explore two fundamental principles of computer science in a playful and engaging
manner using augmented reality during the open house event. This provides students with an opportunity to gauge their
interest in such topics. Additionally, the aim is to integrate this application into regular classroom instruction, allowing
students to apply and experiment with these principles and procedures themselves.
